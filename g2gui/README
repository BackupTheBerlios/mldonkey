MLdonkey G2gui
--------------
MLdonkey G2gui is a graphical frontend to the MLdonkey Core[1].
It is written in java, makes use of SWT and other modern efficient libs
and is fully gcj[2] compliant.
MLdonkey is a multi-network P2P client application.

G2gui comes in several flavours: Additionally to the source for compiling 
it yourself, natively compiled (win32, linux, ...) and java bytecode 
packages are available. 

Compiling it from sources is recommended if you have a recent gcj 
(which is part of the Gnu Compiler Collection), but a version bigger
than 3.2 is strictly required. If compilation fails, using natively 
precompiled binaries is recommended. In case they also refuse to run, 
stick to the java bytecode packages.

Under linux you can choose between gtk2, fox and motif builds. While gtk2 is prettier,
some people prefer fox (and motif to a lesser extent) over gtk2 due to its 
higher responsiveness. You don't have any special choice under windows and MacOS.



Binary Packages
---------------
Win32 packages are statically compiled and should run out of the box on any
decent windows system. Simply unzip the archive and start g2gui.exe.

Linux packages cannot be statically compiled at the moment due to some of gcj's
design limitations, so we recommend to check the shared ones. 
We try to make G2gui available for many distributions.
To run it, simply untar the archive and type ./g2gui.



Java Packages
-------------
G2gui-jar packages contain all and everything, except for a java VM, 
to run MLdonkey G2gui in its byteform. They should run without problems
with any Sun j2re version 1.4x and higher. We've also reports of people
successfully using the "Blackdown" kit with G2gui. "Kaffee" seems to 
produce some memory related problems, but we've not verified this yet.

* Under linux, simply run ./g2gui
* If you are under windows, run g2gui.bat or g2gui.exe if available



Compiling from Sources
----------------------
Unpack the sourcecode ball and do the following:
$ ./configure --enable-batch
$ make 

G2gui requires some external libraries which will be automatically downloaded from
our ftp server if you specify "--enable-batch". The casual user won't have them by
default and configure will tell you to enable this switch to get them.



Usage Tips
----------
G2gui features a few interesting commandline-options, please try:
$ ./g2gui --help
to get a list.

The intersting feature is the link-submission tool. Simply give G2gui
an ed2k:// or .torrent link and it will submit it to the core.



Link Submission
---------------

For Mozilla and Firebird/Firefox users mainly under linux there exists a XPI plugin
called "G2submit", which makes link-submits from the browser easy. It works best
for ed2k://-links. Under windows, simply go to the "Registry"-Tab in the preferences.

When you click a .torrent file in your browser, you can simply choose to "Open with..."
G2gui.exe. G2gui takes the file without further configuration.
