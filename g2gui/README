MLdonkey G2gui
--------------
MLdonkey G2gui is a graphical frontend to the MLdonkey Core[1].
It is written in java, makes use of SWT and other modern efficient libs
and is fully gcj[2] compliant. It aims to replace the old "mlgui" in the future.
MLdonkey is a multi-network P2P client application.

G2gui comes in several flavours: Additionally to the source for compiling 
it yourself, natively compiled (win32, linux, ...) and java bytecode 
packages are available. 

Compiling it from sources is recommended if you have a recent gcj 
(which is part of the Gnu Compiler Colletion), but a version bigger
than 3.2 is strictly required. If compilation fails, using natively 
precompiled binaries is recommended. In case they also refuse to run, 
stick to the java bytecode packages.

Under linux you can choose between gtk2 and motif builds. While gtk2 is prettier,
some people prefer motif over gtk2 due to its slightly higher responsiveness.
You don't have any special choice under windows and MacOS.



Compiling from Sources
----------------------
Unpack the sourcecode ball and do the following:
$ ./configure --enable-batch
$ make 

G2gui requires some external libraries which will be automatically downloaded from
our ftp server if you specify "--enable-batch". The casual user won't have them by
default and configure will tell you to enable this switch to get them.



Binary Packages
---------------
Win32 packages are statically compiled and should run out of the box on any
decent windows system. Simply unzip the archive and start g2gui.exe.

Linux packages cannot be statically compiled at the moment, so we recommend to
check the shared ones. We try to make G2gui available for many distributions.
To run it, simply untar the archive and type ./g2gui.



Java Packages
-------------
g2gui-jar packages contain all end everyting, except for a java VM, 
to run MLdonkey G2gui in its byteform. They should run without problems
with any Sun j2re version 1.4x and higher. We've also reports of people
successfully using the "Blackdown" kit with G2gui. "Kaffee" seems to 
produce some memory related problems, but we've not verified this yet.

* Under linux, simply run ./g2gui.sh
* If you are under windows, run g2gui.bat
