	* now systray-menu is a full-blown SWT-popup-menu. Native interface 
		for windows-systray originally from 
		http://members.lycos.co.uk/gciubotaru/systray/
		all other code adapted for g2gui and SWT.
		If you run g2gui make sure, "DesktopIndicator.dll" is reachable
		for java/ g2gui.exe (i.e. in %PATH%)
		
	
2004/03/02: vnc
	* More hex-encoding related fixes. Using G2gui with a browser
		to open torrents should work now even if there are a lot
		of special characters in the filename.

2004/03/01: vnc
	* Added the ability to directly pass .torrent files to G2gui,
		so you can simply advice your browser to open all 
		torrents with G2gui. It serves the torrent to the core
		via http, by default on port 4081.
		For more information and extended cmdline-parameters
		please check g2gui --help!

2004/02/29: vnc
	* Links are now hex-decoded before submission
	* Improved the local core-handler:
		G2gui now correctly starts, stops and connects
		a local mlnet binary. Even in the event of a G2gui-crash
		the core will survive and G2gui automatically connects upon
		(re)start.
		When a local core has been specified, hostname and port
		are being forced to localhost:4001
