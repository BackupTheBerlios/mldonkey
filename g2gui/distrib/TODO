G2gui's TODO-list (last update: 2004-03-26)
=================
Things with "!" will be implemented/fixed next

 ------------------
| Important things |
 ------------------

* Get the subsearch right and put it to another place

* The mousewheel does not scroll in motif but produces clicks/doubleclicks!
  Very irritating and you accidently download stuff from the results-list etc.

 ----------------------
| Feature Enhancements |
 ----------------------

* stop downloads from search results in case you accicently started it from there
  - use more colors: blue for already downloaded, green for being downloaded

* Introduce the mighty link-extractor
  - Gets a tab of its own
  - Rips websites
  - Includes a big (2/3 of tab?) "smart-board" as link-entry window
    * when stuff is being put into it, automatically extract the
      links and delete the text inbetween
    * ripped links from websites are also put into it
    * its nicely sorted and has checkboxes to select the links for submission
    * a big submit- and clear-button


 -------------------------
| Cosmetics and small bugs|
 -------------------------
* Servercount in networkItem tooltip is wrong,
  connecting servers currently are counted as connected ones

* Increase space between text in table (devein)

* Expanded Transfers should make more of a "block" appearance
  - Transfertable-clients in italics?
  - Same background for clients-rows under gtk?
  - Insert a blank line above and below each block?

* Do something against gtk's contrast-loss when selecting a table-entry
  (example: dark blue selection-bar over dark green text == hardly readable)
  - Make text white or something...
