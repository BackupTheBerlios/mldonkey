G2gui's TODO-list (last update: 30.01.04)
=================

 ------------------
| Important things |
 ------------------
* Make local core-controller relaunch-compatible, without killing the running core.
  Alternatively kill the core and restart it?

* Fix big memleak when relaunching g2gui after a pref-change. MainWindow does not seem to 
  be disposed properly (important!)

* Fix damaged dynamic-column behaviour under linux (important!)

* PreferenceLoader.*Relaunching() is a bit sub-optimal

* Servercount in networkItem tooltip is wrong,
  connecting servers currently are counted as connected ones




 ----------------------
| Feature Enhancements |
 ----------------------
* Introduce the mighty link-extractor
  - Gets a tab of its own
  - Rips websites
  - Includes a big (2/3 of tab?) "smart-board" as link-entry window
    * when stuff is being put into it, automatically extract the
      links and delete the text inbetween
    * ripped links from websites are also put into it
    * its nicely sorted and has checkboxes to select the links for submission
    * a big submit- and clear-button


 -----------
| Cosmetics |
 -----------
* Increase space between text in table (devein)

* Expanded Transfers should make more of a "block" appearance
  - Transfertable-clients in italics?
  - Same background for clients-rows under gtk?
  - Insert a blank line above and below each block?

* Do something against gtk's contrast-loss when selecting a table-entry
  (example: dark blue selection-bar over dark green text == hardly readable)
  - Make text white or something...
