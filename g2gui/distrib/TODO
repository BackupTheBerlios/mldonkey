G2gui's TODO-list (last update: 22.01.04)
=================

----------------
| Major things |
----------------

* Fix damaged dynamic-column behaviour under linux (important!)

* Fix core-connection-loss crash
  - The (to be extended/fixed) relaunch() method should be called
    when the core goes down. A small countdown-window counts down
    from 10 to 0 and tries to connect again (like implemented in teamspeak).
    Label: "x seconds until reconnection attempt...\n Reconnect now?"
    Buttons: <OK> (reconnects immediately) <CANCEL> (goes back to pref-window)

* G2gui relaunch() after some preferences-changes ("*needs restart" candidates)
  - Neededs an extended cleanup-part to make it work


------------------------
| Feature Enhancements |
------------------------
* Introduce the mighty link-extractor
  - Gets a tab of its own
  - Rips websites
  - Includes a big (2/3 of tab?) "smart-board" as link-entry window
    * when stuff is being put into it, automatically extract the
      links and delete the text inbetween
    * ripped links from websites are also put into it
    * its nicely sorted and has checkboxes to select the links for submission
    * a big submit- and clear-button


-------------
| Cosmetics |
-------------
* Increase space between text in table (devein)

* Expanded Transfers should make more of a "block" appearance
  - Transfertable-clients in italics?
  - Same background for clients-rows under gtk?
  - Insert a blank line above and below each block?

* Do something against gtk's contrast-loss when selecting a table-entry
  (example: dark blue selection-bar over dark green text == hardly readable)
  - Make text white or something...
